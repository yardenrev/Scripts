      "Patient: I am eating vegan. Recently, I began bloating in my upper abdomen. I look pregnant. I had ultrasounds done and I have a sludgy gall bladder and 30% fatty liver. I also had tests done for ovarian cancer, but all clear. When I eat, it seems that nothing digests properly. I have this extremely full feeling in my stomach and cant eat. Today I had a green smoothie early, then some homemade vegetable soup, and later (around 2:00), two small clementines. I have not been able to eat anything since. My stomach is really bloated and so full feeling. It is like that more and more as the days are going by. Help!\n",
      "Doctor: Welcome to Chat Doctor ! I have gone through your question, and there are some important concerns: you have sludge in gall bladder, fatty liver, bloating abdomen due to which you can't eat adequately. You have test done for ovarian cancer which is normal. There is no other blood test like - lipid profile, thyroid, renal function test, which will be helpful in your treatment. From my clinical experience I would say that the bloating, and fullness of stomach are due to sludgy gall bladder.  Food is not digested properly when there is fatty liver, and sludge in gall bladder. There is difficulty in digesting fats and other important nutrient from food, even proteins. So, what ever small you eat makes you feel heavy and full. Had I been your doctor I would go for some lipid reducing Chat Doctor?  I think you must consult a surgeon, as many times the sludgy gall bladder needs to be removed with surgery.  The sludge sometimes does slip in bile duct and can result in acute abdominal pain. I'm not trying to scare you but just informing you about the possibilities as you are having significant fullness and bloating. I want to tell you that it is not a serious illness. Had I been at your place, I would go for soft, non-spicy, non-oily diet. Avoid food from outside unless it is thoroughly cooked. This does help in bloating. Small and frequent meals also help along with medicines. Please stop alcohol (if you take it!) completely as it graves the illness. I have seen antacids like Omeprazole 20 mg twice a day, half hour before meals, give immediate relief. Syrups like Di gene can be taken as and when required, about three four times day.  However, most importantly you should go and meet a doctor (preferably a surgeon). Hope the answer helps you. Feel free to ask more queries.\n",
